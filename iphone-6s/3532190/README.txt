# Summary

Obviously I am well behind the times when it comes to cell phones but my IPHONE 6S is still working fine.  Tried printing a few different case models that were available just for fun but none of them fit my phone to my liking so I designed my own.  This model prints great and fits snug.  It also has nice reliefs around the buttons to make adjusting volume and turning off the phone easy without digging into you fingers.  If you are a little behind the times and still have a I-phone 6 give this model a try.   The model should be printed honeycomb side down without supports.
