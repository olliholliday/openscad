# openscad

OpenSCAD models I've made to use with my 3d printer.

:warning: You must use OpenSCAD > version 2019.05.

## iphone6s

A pretty much finished Apple IPhone 6S case. Fits extremely snugly.

It supports the 'customizer' features so you can open the model in OpenSCAD, edit your case thickness and choose the text to emboss on the back.


## galaxy-s7

A first attempt at a Samsung Galaxy S7 case with embossed text. Fits ok but needs the height reducing a little bit.
